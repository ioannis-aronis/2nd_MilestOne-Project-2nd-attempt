# **User stories:**
* As a user, I prefer **simple and elegant looking websites with clear subpages**.
= The website is designed in a simple and elegant way so as not to confuse any visitors even if they enter in it for the first time and are also new to the web.
    Easy and light colours have been uses as well as clear fonts and big sized fonts to be very easily readable by anyone.

* As a user, I prefer **an easy to learn navigation system / bar** in any website I visit. 
    The reasons for that is that I save a lot of time by trying to understand the navigation functions implemented in a website and I am not getting frustrated or lost because usually if I do or if I find out it is fuzzy and complex, I leave from the website, fast.

= The navigation system of the website consists of a navigation bar (navbar) located at the top of the website and is visible from all subwebpages of the website.
    Very easy and immediate is actually aclick and go system.

* As a user, I want to visit **web responsive websites** which literally translates to *''friendly and easy use and access in all devices formats, desktop, tablet or mobile.
= Any website nowadays must be web responsive due to the multiple devises people use in a daily basis. Either someone is on the move aor at home or their work everyone uses multiple devices during each day.
The website has been designed as web responsive. 3 out of 5 of its webpages are fuctioning responsive 100% at the moment. Due to lack of time to resolve issues (bugs) the remaining 2 pages out of five are not 100% full responsive.
For the same reason the navbar needs a bug fix for becoming 100% responsive.

* As a user, I want to visit **''easy to use and easy to access''** websites in terms of filling in information.
= As the website is very simple in his concept and functions, so is the contact page and contact form. Basic data are needed to be filled-in for anyone to contact the imaginary company.
An embedded google map that is working fully responsively is added as an easy access and useful tool on the website for navigating anyone to the offices of the imaginary company. The offices are pre-tagged.

* As a user, I want to **move to subwebpages of the website** rather fast and easy.
= Through the navbar this is a very easy thing to do for anyone who surfs in the website.

* As a user, I want to **click on a link of a project of the imaginary company** to grasp an idea of their work.
= £ links , 3 immediate redrections to each projects individual webpage.
Very easy and easy to undertsnad and use way to take a look at projects that the imaginary company is involved in and / or has successfully completed.

* As a user, I want to find **more information about the imaginary company and its founder.**
The user’s goals can be met via this website as he interacts and uses a clear, simple and elegant web responsive website.
= Again throgh the navbar, the user clicks in the "About Us" section and immediately he is redirected to the specific webpage with the necessary information.


As this project (MS1) is basically my first project ever, it was important for me to keep it simple looking and in content too as to not overwhelm a first-time visitor - user (and also myself with information not clearly coprehensive to me, as a student, yet).
With the navbar fixed on top, it is easy for users to navigate and be able to choose to go / move to another subwebpage of the same website wherever they are on the current page at any given time.

All links open into a new tab so the user will not forget *'Storyteller'* website and can go back to it very easy by clikcing on iys own individual "tab" .

   Total mess when I had to apply the entire thing. Bugs everywhere! It took me a very long time too get over this issue, I still have issues understanding its implementation"
