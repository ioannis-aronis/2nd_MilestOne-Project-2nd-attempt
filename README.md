# [ ''**_Storyteller_** '' ](https://ioannis-aronis.github.io/1st-Milestone-Project/index.html)

## _**''An imaginary consultancy company's website''**_
My 1st Milestone Project from Code Academy's **_Full Stack Web Developer Program / Course_** 
, **_User Centric Front-End Development Module_** is about a static website that informs the potential visitors 
of an imaginary consultancy company that is specialized in the hospitality and the catering sector as well as
its founder.

It provides them with biographical information for both the company and its founder, as well as 
the places and the clients / businesses names that the company has been involved in by deploying
 and completing projects there and with for the specific clients / businesses.

Also The visitors during their search in the website are given the opportunity to visit other pages
 that have to do with some of the ompany's projects.

This website is my actual first attempt in the world of code (MS1).
It is a presentation-1st attempt to implement what I have learned and understood so far from Code Institute's
 *HTML Essentials*, *CSS Essentials* and *User Centric Front-End Development* modules.

I aimed to the creation of a website in which the **_storytelling_** of an imaginary Experienced Manager and founder
 of his own company that undertakes projects in the Tourist/Hospitality/Catering sector **_unfolds_** in a clear and simple way.

Anyone who navigates to the webpages of the specific website is able to easily find contact details, 
the projects that the company has been involved and/or completed, the places the businesses - clients were based as well as their names

Therefore the visitors of the website should clearly grasp what the imaginary company does.

Reasons that potential users may be entering the website, are the following:

* Users may wish to experience a demonstration of a front-end presentation of one of my projects, first hand.
* Users may wish to investigate and read through the HTML5, CSS3 and other potential libraries I used for completing this particular project.
* Users may wish to understand and see my front-end design perception as a junior web developer.

# **UX**
A simple and clean design of a website that demonstrates my abilities on creating 
a website presentation for an imaginary company and its founder of another sector 
who wants to amplify his communication with new parnterships and display his work 
and experience in his sector.

It consists of 5 pages:
1. A **'home page'** that introduces the user who visit the website to 3 of the imaginary companny's projects each one with its logo images, 
   a brief description-moto and a link underneath that when clicked leads to their own websites. Additionally to the same home page by scrolling further down,
   the visitors / users will find a contact form that they can easily fill it and contact the imaginary company directly.

2. A **'Contact'** page which allows the user to immediately communicate with the imaginary company so as to give them more information of their needs 
   and / or send a job proposal to the company.

3. A **'Projects'** page that allows the visitor - user to directly visit the webpages of these completed projects selected from the imaginary companie's portfolio.
   A minimum display of 3 projects jigsahas been selected.

4. An **'About Us'** page that leads the user directly to a small BIO sub webpage about the imaginary company and its founder.

5. A **'Consultancy Services'** page that gives access to the visitor - user to information about previous projects that the imaginary company 
   has been involved in as well as what are the offered services the of imaginary company.

# **User journey:**
1. The visitor - user begins at the **'Home'** page. At first on the top-left the visitor - user is seeing the logo and underneath the navbar.
 Just under that is the hero image of a happy man smiling while workinmg on a project of his in his laptop. On the bottom of the hero image the visitor - user can read a welocme message.

    [Home Page](https://ioannis-aronis.github.io/1st-Milestone-Project/index.html)
            
2. Scrolling down to the next section of the home page,the visitor - user can see 3 images,to 3 of the imaginary company's projects, their names, a moto of what they actually offer and links. 
Whenever the visitor - user of clicks on a link / button is redirected to each project's own webpage.  Alternately the visitor - user can scroll further down to the next section of the home page.

3. The website's links open in new tabs for the external websites.

    [Home Page](https://ioannis-aronis.github.io/1st-Milestone-Project/index.html)
            
4. At the next section of the home page is a contact form so as for the visitor - user to send his contact details and also info on what information and / or services he / she needs from the imaginary company.
Undeneathr the contact form there is a map with the address of the company's office tagged on the map.

# **User stories:**
* As a user, I prefer **simple and elegant looking websites with clear subpages**.

* As a user, I prefer **an easy to learn navigation system / bar** in any website I visit. 
    
    The reasons for that is that I save a lot of time by trying to understand the navigation functions implemented in a website and I am not getting frustrated or lost because usually if I do or if I find out it is fuzzy and complex, I leave from the website, fast.

* As a user, I want to visit **web responsive websites** which literally translates to *''friendly and easy use and access in all devices formats, desktop, tablet or mobile.

* As a user, I want to visit **''easy to use and easy to access''** websites in terms of filling in information.

* As a user, I want to **move to subwebpages of the website** rather fast and easy.

* As a user, I want to **click on a link of a project of the imaginary company** to grasp an idea of their work.

* As a user, I want to find **more information about the imaginary company and its founder.**

The user’s goals can be met via this website as he interacts and uses a clear, simple and elegant web responsive website.

As this project (MS1) is basically my first project ever, it was important for me to keep it simple looking and in content too as to not overwhelm a first-time visitor - user (and also myself with information not clearly coprehensive to me, as a student, yet).

With the navbar fixed on top, it is easy for users to navigate and be able to choose to go / move to another subwebpage of the same website wherever they are on the current page at any given time.

All links open into a new tab so the user will not forget *'Storyteller'* website and can go back to it very easy by clikcing on iys own individual "tab" .

# **Wireframes**
I used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) to create wireframes in desktop, tablet and phone view.
The wireframes can be found (are in .pdf) in the Wireframes folder on this project.

# **Features**
All five (5) pages consist of a fixed navigation menu bar on top where you can click to go to any of the five (5) pages wherever you are on the current page. 

All five (5) pages also consist of the same social links taking the users to a new tab with the relevant social media of the imaginary company's homepage as it is a fictional one and there are no social media accounts.

The five (5) pages also consist of the same footer with the imaginary company's phone number and underneath is the copyright information.

The choice of the font called 'Open Sans' was made for consistency of the overall user experience and simplicity of appearance.

# [**Home.html**](https://ioannis-aronis.github.io/1st-Milestone-Project/index.html)
This page under the navbar has a hero image of the imaginary manager, wearing a white T-shirt, smiling, while he is working at his laptop, taking notes, with a take-away coffee cup next to him. This image sends the user a sense of familiarity with the imaginary manager and it inspires the user to feel somehow that this person is friendly and potentialy looks like a person that the user ia a friend too. The name of the imaginary manager ‘IOANNIS ARONIS’ is displayed, underneath the name of the website's title ''Storyteller'' which is loavetd on th upper left corner of the screen. The titlte makes a statement for the the reason this website was created for.

Next is a welcome text-prhase as the user scrolls down a little bit and after that the user can read the word ‘Projects’ which almost immediately leads the user to the core of the imaginary company's purpose of creating a website. 
Right after that section, three images of projects follow, each occuping a third of the screen's width. There is a brief title of each project and a link that when clicked it leads to another website that refers to the specific project-business.

Next follows a Moto phrase.

The next section is a 'CONTACT FORM' which consists of three (3)) sub sections. Each one of the first two sub sections occupies 50% of the screen's width.Thee third sub section is under them occupying 80% of the screen's width.

The left sub section contains simple information of the imaginary company such as the address of the offices, email and phone number.

The right sub section contains the contact form's fields that the users must complete in order to contact and there after will be contacted by the imaginary company.
The fields that need to be filled-in in the contact form are a Full Name field, an Email field, A Phone field, an Address field, and a Text Input field.

Last but not least (to say the least) is a ‘Send’ Button for the users to click once they have finished filling-in the contact form's fields.

Then there is the ‘Map’ section right under the contact form which informs the users of the imaginary company's offices address, tagged on the map for a GPS easy input use. The ‘Map’ section occupies almost the entire width of the screen. 

There is a smooth colour-optical transition as the contact form and the map seem to be ''engulfed'' form a grey container box.

At the bottom of the page "rests" the footer section.

At the footer section just underneath the written phone of the imaginary company and the copyright information tehre are social icon links that when clicked they lead to the social media of the imaginary company.

# [**About Us.html**](https://ioannis-aronis.github.io/1st-Milestone-Project/about-me.html)
This page has no hero image so as not to dιstract the user from the purpose it has been created for.

Instead after the navbar a grey container box immediately follows. Inside it, centerd on top is written the title 'BIO' and under it brief descriptive information is written. The texts that follow are also centered.

Just underneath at the footer section the written phone of the imaginary company and the copyright information tehre are social icon links that when clicked they lead to the social media of the imaginary company.

# [**Projects.html**](https://ioannis-aronis.github.io/1st-Milestone-Project/work.html)
This page has also no hero image so as not to dιstract the user from the purpose it has been created for, as well.

Instead it has the title 'PROJECTS Our Professional Journey' centered under the navbar.

Next section as the user scrolls down a little bit is a display of three (3) previous successful projects the imaginary company was involved.

Three images, each occuping a third of the screen's width. There is a brief title of each project and a link that when clicked it leads to another website-redirects the user to each project's individual webpages.

Just underneath at the footer section the written phone of the imaginary company and the copyright information tehre are social icon links that when clicked they lead to the social media of the imaginary company.

# [**Consultancy Services.html**](https://ioannis-aronis.github.io/1st-Milestone-Project/cv.html)
This page has also no hero image as well so as not to dιstract the user from the purpose it has been created for.

Instead after the navbar a grey container box immediately follows. Inside it, centered and on top the title 'List of Our Completed Projects' 
is written and under it, also centered, there is a list of all previous projects the company has successfully completed.
 
Under that section there is another similar section that follows in a light grey background colour and there written and centered are the services the imaginary company provides.

Just underneath at the footer section the written phone of the imaginary company and the copyright information tehre are social icon links that when clicked they lead to the social media of the imaginary company.

# [**Contact.html**](https://ioannis-aronis.github.io/1st-Milestone-Project/contact.html)
This page has no hero image so as not to dιstract the user from the purpose it has been created for.

This page under the navbar has a 'CONTACT FORM' which consists of two (2) sub sections. Each sub section occupies 50% of the screens width.

The left sub section contains simple infromation of the imaginary manager such as the address of his office, his email and his phone number.

The right sub section contains the contact form's fields that the users must complete in order to contact and there after will be contacted by the imaginary manager.
The fields that need to be filled-in in the contact form are a Full Name field, an Email field, A Phone field, an Address field, A Subject field and a Text Input field.

Last but not least (to say the least) is a ‘Submit’ Button for the users to click once they have finished filling-in the contact form's fields. If the user clicks the button without completing all valid and/or necessary fields of the contact form, a message is displayed to fill in the appropriate field. When user hovers over the button it goes a lighter grey in colour.

Then there is the ‘Map’ section right under the contact form which informs the users of the imaginary manager's office web address, tagged on the map for a GPS easy input use. The ‘Map’ section occupies the entire width of the screen. 

At the bottom of the page is a grey container box that separates the webpage last section from the footer section, while showing a smooth colour-optical transition from contact form which appears to ''engulf'' the grey container box also occupies the entire width of the screen.

Just underneath in the footer section the phone of the imaginary manager is written and under that the copyright information is written.

# **Features Left to Implement**
